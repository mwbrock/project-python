# Hollywood Movie Rating Program - Version 1
# Simple Solution.

# Version 1 is a simple program that demonstrates the use of loops and logic
# control structures to keep a running total in Python. It gives a user 3
# attempts to enter a valid star rating for the featured movie and displays
# an error message after a third failed attempt, exiting the program. Otherwise,
# it displays a message indicating what the user entered has been noted.

# NOTE: This program didn't quite satisfy the assignment requirements, so #
# I wrote a Version 3 that does, which is more advanced in nature.        #
