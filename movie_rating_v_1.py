# Hollywood Movie Rating Program - Version 1
# Simple Solution 1 with Running Total and NO Calculated Average

# Version 1 is a simple program that demonstrates the use of loops and logic
# control structures to keep a running total in Python. It gives a user three
# attempts to enter a valid star rating for the featured movie, then it either
# displays an error message after a third failed attempt, exiting the program,
# or displays a success message, indicating what the user entered has been
# noted, and exits the program.

# NOTE: Versions 1 & 2 didn't quite satisfy the assignment requirements,  #
# so I wrote a Version 3 that does, which is more advanced in nature.     #

import sys # Required for sys.exit function. (NOT in textbook!)

# Create a global constant for the maximum number of tries.

###########################################################################
# NOTE: In this case, I made it global simply to make it easier to change #
# later, if necessary, because it's at the top of the program.            #
