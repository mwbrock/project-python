# Library System Simulation Program in Python - Version 1

################################################################################
# NOTE: Version 1 is one of the first Python programs that I ever wrote, and I #
# was still learning the syntax and different types of for loop constructs. It #
# does work, but it didn't quite satisfy the assignment requirements (i.e.,    #
# using nested or two-dimensional lists), so I created a Version 2 that does.  #
# I only included Version 1 here to show that there is another way to do it    #
# using multiple one-dimensional lists.                                        #
################################################################################

# This program simulates a library system with library card number validation,
# a search options menu, and various functions to test, manipulate and retrieve
# data. The search options menu allows users to search for a book by ISBN or by
# title, or to quit the program. The exercise has predefined function signatures
# that the students are required to implement and use in their code whenever
# they are appropriate.

import sys # Required for sys.exit() function. (NOT in textbook!)

# Create global constants for the menu choices.
ISBN_SEARCH = 1
TITLE_SEARCH = 2
QUIT_CHOICE = 3

################################################################################
# NOTE: Normally, this type of program would be accessing the data from either #
# databases or dictionaries. But since the students working on this exercise   #
# have not been introduced to these concepts yet and are working with lists, I #
# wrote this program with that in mind.                                        #
################################################################################

# Create a global two-dimensional list with 3 rows and 2 columns, where rows
# represent individual books and columns represent titles and 10-digit ISBNs.
# This list is used for testing purposes only, and the data would normally be
# obtained from a database or dictionary. I made it global so that it could be
# used by all of the functions described in the assignment.
books = [['Animal Farm', '0452284244'], ['Brave New World', '0060850523'], ['Catch-22', '0684833395']]

################################################################################
# NOTE: I tried using a nested list, as shown above, but I discovered that the #
# in operator doesn't work as expected in this case, which I confirmed online  #
# at: http://kracekumar.com/post/22512660850/python-in-operator-use-cases      #
# So I had to resolve to making separate lists of the book titles and ISBNs,   #
# with their indexes matching accordingly.                                     #
