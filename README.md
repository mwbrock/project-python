project-python
==============

This repo is a collection of Python programs that I wrote while doing my internship as an Instructional Support Specialist at St. Petersburg College. These programs are from the assignments that I assisted other students with and are intended to help novice Python programmers learn the language's syntax and structure. Interestingly enough, I'm not formally trained in Python and am learning it as I go in order to better help my peers. I welcome other programmers to submit there Python programs for educational purposes.
