This repository (a.k.a. repo) is a collection of Python programs that I wrote while doing my internship as an Instructional Support Specialist at St. Petersburg College's Learning Support Center located on the Clearwater campus, Florida (USA). These programs are from the assignments that I assisted other students with during this time and are intended to help novice Python programmers learn the language's syntax and structure. They range from beginner to intermediate in terms of the level of difficulty.

Interestingly enough, I'm not formally trained in Python and am learning it as I go along in order to better help my peers taking Introduction to Computer Programming. The textbook used for the course is: Starting Out With Python (2nd ed ) by Tony Gaddis (Pearson, 2012).

Moreover, I'm only a junior computer programmer / software developer at the moment, who is finishing up my AS degree in Computer/Web Programming and Analysis and about to graduate with high honors later this month. I'm also new to GitHub and still learning its capabilities, features, and uses, which is one of my internship learning objectives. Another one of my learning objectives involves researching open source projects and contributing something to one of them.

However, I've been very busy with not only my internship position's responsibilities but also many personal obligations and unexpected obstacles that have made completing these learning objectives quite a challenge. For example, my home computer crashed recently with the dreaded "Blue Screen of Death" due to memory and disk errors, which required a friend's help in repairing it and took over a week to fix.

So I decided to basically start my own open source project in the form of this repo: project-python. As such, I welcome other programmers to submit their Python programs, tips and/or comments here for educational purposes.
