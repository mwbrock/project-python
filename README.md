README

This repository (a.k.a. repo) is a collection of Python programs that I wrote while doing my internship as an Instructional Support Specialist (cf. Tutor) at the Learning Support Center of St. Petersburg College's (SPC) Clearwater campus in Florida (USA). These programs are solutions to the assignments that I assisted other students with during this semester and are provided here to help novice Python programmers learn the language's basic syntax and common control structures. A few of them have different versions, which are indicated in the file names, that evolved progressively from one to the other. Collectively, they range from beginner to intermediate in terms of the level of difficulty, are thoroughly commented (i.e., technically documented) throughout, and are intended for educational purposes only.

As a point of information, at the time of this writing, I'm not formally trained in Python and am currently teaching it to myself to satisfy the first learning objective for my internship and in order to facilitate students taking Introduction to Computer Programming at SPC. So I'm not a Python expert by any means and these programs may not be the best way to accomplish the required tasks. Nevertheless, they all work as expected and achieve the desired results. More importantly, all of the students that I've helped told me that they received "As" on their respective assignments. The textbook used for the course is *Starting Out With Python* (2nd ed.) by Tony Gaddis (Pearson, 2012).

Moreover, I'm only a junior computer programmer / software developer at the moment, who is finishing up my AS degree in Computer/Web Programming and Analysis and about to graduate from SPC with high honors later this month. My formal computer programming training has been focused on the *fundamentals* of C++, C#, Java and Objective-C, along with cross-platform mobile device and web applications development using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 

So I'm relatively new to computer programming and admittedly still have a lot to learn. I'm also new to GitHub and am still discovering its many capabilities, features and uses, which is one of my internship learning objectives. Another one of my learning objectives involves researching *open source* projects and contributing something to one of them.

However, I've been very busy with not only my various internship position's responsibilities but also many personal obligations and unexpected obstacles that have made pursuing these learning objectives quite a challenge. For example, my home computer crashed recently with the dreaded "Blue Screen of Death" due to memory and disk errors, which required a friend's help in repairing and took over a week to fix.

Therefore, I merely decided to just start my own *open source* project in the form of this repo: project-python. Now I realize that there may be some differences of opinion and/or varied interpretations as to what *open source* means. As such, let me clarify the context in which the term *open source* is being used herein. 

While I'm providing neither a license such as the GNU General Public License, nor a warranty of any kind with these programs, I'm sharing them freely in a public repo via GitHub, from which anyone is allowed to view and fork their source code. And, in its most basic form, *open source* refers to computer programs/software whose source code *"can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone"* (http://opensource.org). 

So, by my understanding of the preceding description, this repo and the Python programs that comprise it are considered *open source* in nature. Hence, I welcome other programmers to share their own Python programs, tips, tricks or comments here for educational purposes. And fork away, of course!  ;)
