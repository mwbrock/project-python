# Library System Simulation Program in Python - Version 2

################################################################################
# NOTE: Version 2 was made to satisfy the assignment requirements of using a   #
# "list of lists" (a.k.a. "nested list" or "two-dimensional list"). Also, I    #
# cleaned up the code and used different logic control structures herein.        #
################################################################################

# This program simulates a library system with library card number validation,
# a search options menu, and various functions to test, manipulate and retrieve
# data. The search options menu allows users to search for a book by ISBN or by
# title, or to quit the program. The exercise has predefined function signatures
# that the students are required to implement and use in their code whenever
# they are appropriate.

import sys # Required for sys.exit() function. (NOT in textbook!)

# Create global constants for the menu choices.
ISBN_SEARCH = 1
TITLE_SEARCH = 2
QUIT_CHOICE = 3
    
################################################################################
# NOTE: Normally, this type of program would be accessing the data from either #
# databases or dictionaries. But since the students working on this exercise   #
# have not been introduced to these concepts yet and are working with lists, I #
# wrote this program with that in mind.                                        #

# Create a global two-dimensional list with 3 rows and 3 columns, where rows
# represent individual books and columns represent titles, 10-digit ISBNs and
# a 'y' or 'n' character for availability. This list is used for testing purposes
# only, and the data would normally be obtained from a database or dictionary. I
# made it global so that it could be used by all of the functions described in
# the assignment.
